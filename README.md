# Stanford Algorithms Specialization

This repository contains my solutions and projects for the **Stanford Algorithms Specialization** on Coursera, taught by Professor Tim Roughgarden. This four-course series provides a comprehensive introduction to algorithms, focusing on conceptual understanding and practical applications.

## Specialization Overview
The specialization covers a broad range of algorithms, with an emphasis on problem-solving and technical interview preparation. Each course includes weekly quizzes, programming assignments, and a final exam to solidify the key concepts.

### Courses
1. **Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms**  
   [16 hours]  
   Core algorithms and techniques in divide-and-conquer, sorting, searching, and randomized algorithms.

2. **Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures**  
   [15 hours]  
   Graph algorithms, shortest paths, and essential data structures.

3. **Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming**  
   [15 hours]  
   Techniques for optimization problems, greedy algorithms, and dynamic programming.

4. **Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems, and What To Do About Them**  
   [13 hours]  
   Advanced algorithms, NP-completeness, and approaches to intractable problems.

## Instructor
**Tim Roughgarden**, Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University, is a leading expert in algorithms and their applications.

## Applied Learning
Each course includes:
- Weekly multiple-choice quizzes
- Weekly programming assignments in your preferred programming language
- Final exams to assess overall understanding
